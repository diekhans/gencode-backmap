Test data

- data/GRCh38-GRCh37.mapping.chains
  Subset of chains needed to test mappings.  This was generated with:

     gff3ToGenePred data/gencode.v22.annotation.gff3 test.gp
     overlapSelect  test.gp /cluster/data/genomes/hg38/bed/liftOver/hg38ToHg19.over.chain.gz test.chains

  Then editing to replace chrM with a one-to-one chain.  This is needed because hg19 including a different
  chrM than was in GRGh37 lite and used by GENCODE.

- data/gencode.v22.annotation.gff3
  Test subset of annotations in GFF3 format
- data/gencode.v22.annotation.gtf
  Test subset of annotations in GTF format
- data/gencode.v22.metadata.PolyA_feature
  PolyA features to map, these have corresponding entries in the gff3/gtf files.
