Test data

- data/hg38ToHg19.over.chain
  Subset of UCSC chains needed to test mappings. These will be lifted by
  the ucscLiftEdit command. This is generated with `make mappingChains`

- data/GRCh38.p2-GRCh37.p13.gencode.psl
  Subset of NCBI chains needed to test mappings. Also generated with
  `make mappingChains`.

- data/altSeqPatchesP10.bed
  Patch and incident regions on GRCh37  This is generates with make problemRegions.

- data/gencode.v22.annotation.gff3
  Test subset of annotations in GFF3 format
- data/gencode.v22.annotation.gtf
  Test subset of annotations in GTF format
- data/gencode.v22.metadata.PolyA_feature
  PolyA features to map, these have corresponding entries in the gff3/gtf files.

- data/gencode.v29.annotation.gff3
  - ENST00000427575.5 - didn't map, liftover is clean
  - ENST00000624084.2 - didn't map, mapped in v26lift37 but not v29lift37, not in V19
  - ENST00000397527.5 - 1-base gap in CDS mapping  
  - ENST00000650192.1 - got both V19 and V29 versions;
     - V29 ENST00000650192.1   AC003070.7
     - V19 ENST00000363083.1   RNA5SP443

- data/idChange.v25.gff3
  - ENST00000384889.1 is a MIR in MIR224 that was accidental put in GABRE in v25

- data/gencode.v31.annotation.gff3
  - Merged gene: ENST00000448113.1 and ENST00000424819.1 were in ENSG00000226155.1,
    they moved to ENSG00000224614.2 in V31 due to a transcript being merged with the
    adjacent gene.  ENSG00000286004.1 was needed to trigger the bug since unstable
    gene symbol "AC124944.3" was being checked.

- data/dup-transcripts.v33.gff3
  data/dup-transcripts.v19.gff3 
  data/dup-transcripts.v32lift37.gff3
  - test cases where multiple instances of an transcript id were add to the output
    v19: ENSG00000233067.2 / ENST00000608254.1 ENST00000455399.1

- data/gapped-transcripts.v33.gff3
  - one bass gap in CDS of ENST00000425525.1 and ENST00000397527.6 caused by alignment.

    SPRY3 is  problematic in that it was on chrY at V19 then dropped from chrY because
    it had one transcript that went beyond the PAR.  However, it was not added
    back in in V44.
