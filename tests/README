Test data

- data/hg38ToHg19.over.chain
  Subset of UCSC chains needed to test mappings. These will be lifted by
  the ucscLiftEdit command. This is generated with `make mappingChains`

- data/GRCh38.p2-GRCh37.p13.gencode.psl
  Subset of NCBI chains needed to test mappings. Also generated with
  `make mappingChains`.

- data/altSeqPatchesP10.bed
  Patch and incident regions on GRCh37  This is generates with make problemRegions.

- data/gencode.v22.annotation.gff3
  Test subset of annotations in GFF3 format
- data/gencode.v22.annotation.gtf
  Test subset of annotations in GTF format
- data/gencode.v22.metadata.PolyA_feature
  PolyA features to map, these have corresponding entries in the gff3/gtf files.

- data/gencode.v29.annotation.gff3
  - ENST00000427575.5 - didn't map, liftover is clean
  - ENST00000624084.2 - didn't map, mapped in v26lift37 but not v29lift37, not in V19
  - ENST00000397527.5 - 1-base gap in CDS mapping  
  - ENST00000650192.1 - got both V19 and V29 versions;
     - V29 ENST00000650192.1   AC003070.7
     - V19 ENST00000363083.1   RNA5SP443

- data/idChange.v25.gff3
  - ENST00000384889.1 is a MIR in MIR224 that was accidental put in GABRE in v25

- data/gencode.v31.annotation.gff3
  - Merged gene: ENST00000448113.1 and ENST00000424819.1 were in ENSG00000226155.1,
    they moved to ENSG00000224614.2 in V31 due to a transcript being merged with the
    adjacent gene.  ENSG00000286004.1 was needed to trigger the bug since unstable
    gene symbol "AC124944.3" was being checked.

- data/dup-transcripts.v33.gff3
  data/dup-transcripts.v19.gff3 
  data/dup-transcripts.v32lift37.gff3
  - test cases where multiple instances of an transcript id were add to the output
    v19: ENSG00000233067.2 / ENST00000608254.1 ENST00000455399.1
    v33: ENSG00000233067.4 / ENST00000669979.1
         ENSG00000288546.1 / ENST00000608254.1 ENST00000455399.1

- data/gapped-transcripts.v33.gff3
  - one bass gap in CDS of ENST00000425525.1 and ENST00000397527.6 caused by alignment.
