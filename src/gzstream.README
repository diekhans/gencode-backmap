This is an import of gzstream 1.4 from
http://www.cs.unc.edu/Research/compgeom/gzstream/

This was used of in place of zfstream that is included with zlib due
to it's early compatibility with gcc 3.*.

The following modifications were made:
    - rename gzstream.C to gzstream.cc
    - added attach() method
