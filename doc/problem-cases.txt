- ZNF577 - no longer manually annotated
    - in V19/V20, gene was manually annotated with multiple transcripts.
    - in V25, gene is automatic, with one transcript plus a second transcript
      being in moved to gene AC074141.1
    - RefSeq continues to annotation this gene

- ZNF883 - no longer manually annotated
   - in V19/V20 - manual, lincRNA
   - in V25 - automatic, protein_coding


- PPIAL4E/PPIAL4F- gene name swap
  - genes names swapped for locus V19+V20 to V25
  - both change from pseudogene to protein_coding
  - gene id instablity
