* drop remap_num_mappings attribute, as it makes less sense now that filter per same chromosome
* remove use of havana ids, seems redundant, not sure they can sort anything out
* REMAP_STATUS_NON_PRIMARY is no longer useful since discard mapping not to the same chromosome.
* issues with multiple ids.
in theory, should only happen in PAR
** Test case transmoveTest gives different results depending on order of README.
this has to do with case were transcripts have moved between gene vs target.  See tests/README.
*** void AnnotationSet::checkForMultiIdVersions(FeatureNode* feature) const
just warns
